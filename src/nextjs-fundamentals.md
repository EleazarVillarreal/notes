# Next.js Fundamentals

## General
* Next.js is a React framework for building scalable hybrid applications, supporting both static sites and fully dynamic web apps.

## Routing
* In Next.js, a folder inside the app directory becomes a public route only if it contains a `page.{tsx,jsx,js}` file. Without this file, the folder remains inaccessible to the public.
