# Docker

* Ensures consistency across environments.
* Allows you to ship an application and the environment it runs in.

## General
* Docker Daemon - Listens to requests from the desktop app and executes them.
* Docker Desktop - The visual way to interact with Docker. Starting the GUI should start the server.
* Docker CLI - Allows you to execute Docker commands through the command line.
* Docker Hub - The official cloud service for storing and sharking Docker images.
* Container - A standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. It is a running instance of an image.
* Image - A read-only definition of an application and everything it needs to run properly.

## Commands
* `docker pull <image_name>` - Pulls an image from Docker Hub.
* `docker images` - Lists all your local images.
